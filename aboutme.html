            <p>I have a great interest in the creative and coding side of IT, I enjoy working on websites and their aesthetics, I am also interested in the coding side of web development as well as animations.<p>
            <p>I am looking towards either Front end development or UI UX design, or anything similar to this field. However I am still open to other options in fields of IT to gain experience and skills.</p>
